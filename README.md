## Introduction  
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major global health issue that can lead to severe complications if left untreated. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of CKD. The objective is to assist healthcare providers in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Collection**:  
   - The dataset contains patient data, including features such as age, blood pressure, glucose levels, and creatinine levels.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Scaled numeric features  
   - Encoded categorical variables  

3. **Feature Selection**:  
   - Selected key predictors of CKD for efficient model training.  

4. **Model Building**:  
   - Tested algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.  
   - Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.  

5. **Evaluation**:  
   - Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
